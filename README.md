# Guessing_Game

This Python script implements a **number guessing game** where the program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player must guess it. The game provides feedback if the guess is **too high or too low** and keeps track of the number of attempts. The loop continues until the player guesses the correct number, at which point the game congratulates them and displays the total attempts taken.
